# Installation Instructions
# Usage Instructions
1. Assuming that a camera (IP camera), an embedded device (raspberry pi) and a monitor (We used a laptop monitor for this project) are present.
2. 
### Milestone 1
  **Requirement**: - *AI Model for Object Recognition*
                   - *Embedded System Device*
                   - *Camera*
# Technologies Used
## Hardware
  - Raspberry PI 4
  - Android Phone (For Camera)
  - Video Capturer Adapter
## Software
  - OBS Studio (To use laptop screen as a monitor)
  - ultralytics (YOLOv11)# Milestones
## Milestone 1
## Summary
    Implemention of a basic object recognition system using a pretrained YOLOv11 model on a raspberry pi 4 using a an IP camera (From an android phone). The result of the detection are displayed on a desktop monitor.
# Credits
  This project is part of the coursework in CS5401 - Special Topics in Computer Science
# Known Issues
  At the moment, there is significant lag between the time a video is captured by the camera and and the output is rendered on the screen (With the bounded boxes showing a classified object an the accuracy)
